## Overveiw:
This project was built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. Most all of the HTML content is generated dynamically through JavaScript.

## How to play the game?
- When you click Start, you will be given 9 multiple-choice questions about The Simpsons.
- You have 60 seconds to answer all the questions before time runs out.
- If you finish early, you can quit sooner by clicking the Answer button.
- The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
- When the game ends, your score will be displayed for you.
